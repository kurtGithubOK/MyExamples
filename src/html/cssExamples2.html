    <span class="shaded">This is in a &lt;span&gt; tag.  No CRLF & only contents-wide.</span>
    <div class="shaded">&lt;div&gt; tags include a CRLF and are full width.</div>
    <div class="shaded widthAndMargins">This div tag has its width set to 200px and margins set to 'auto' to center it.</div>
    <div class="shaded maxWidthAndMargins">Same as above but with max-width set to 600px so that contents will shrink when the 
        window is narrowed and thus prevent horizontal scrolling.   Margins still set to 'auto' to center it.</div>
