'#' signs are used to make headers.  Example:

# '#' This is an `<h1>` tag.
## '##' This is an `<h2>` tag.
### '###' This is an `<h3>` tag.
#### '####' This is an `<h4>` tag.
##### '#####' This is an `<h5>` tag.

This is a block quote:
> "There comes a time in
> everyone's life when 
> you have to do whatever and such ..."

Code:  Use backticks, not forward ticks like I do: `<html>`,
and here is a JS function:

```[bash|python]
    function myFunction() {
        <statements here ...>
    }
```
